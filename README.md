Here I implement a user friendly python script that predicts a stock or ETF's closing price.
I used Lasso linear regression on many years of data publicly available [here](https://www.kaggle.com/borismarjanovic/price-volume-data-for-all-us-stocks-etfs).

To run this on your computer, git clone the repository, go to the data URL, download the data, and copy the data folder into the cloned repository directory.
Then you can run `python pred_stock.py`. 

Enjoy!
